You are tasked with developing a comprehensive solution to prepare a dataset for training AI models from hundreds of Arabic scanned PDF files. The solution must include a user-friendly control interface for the entire data upload and preparation process.

### Requirements:

1. **Data Upload Interface:**

   * Provide a simple, intuitive control interface allowing users to upload multiple Arabic scanned PDF files at once.
   * Ensure robust handling of large uploads (hundreds of files).

2. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):**

   * Implement reliable OCR specifically optimized for Arabic text.
   * Extract text accurately from scanned PDFs, addressing common OCR challenges such as text orientation, clarity, and quality variations.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**

   * Automatically clean the extracted text, removing irrelevant characters, symbols, or artifacts.
   * Normalize Arabic text to ensure consistency, including handling diacritics, punctuation, and character encoding.

4. **Dataset Structuring:**

   * Organize the extracted and cleaned data into a structured format suitable for training (e.g., CSV, JSON).
   * Clearly label and categorize data entries as needed.

5. **Control Interface Features:**

   * Include functionalities for previewing uploaded PDFs and extracted texts.
   * Provide visual indicators or progress tracking for data processing stages (upload, OCR, cleaning, structuring).
   * Allow users to manually correct OCR results if necessary through an interactive editing tool integrated within the interface.

6. **Download and Export:**

   * Enable easy export of the final prepared dataset in standard formats (CSV, JSON) directly from the control interface.

7. **Storage:**

   * Store output files securely in a designated storage location accessible through the control interface.
   * Provide clear documentation on accessing, managing, and maintaining the stored data.

### Deliverables:

* Complete source code for the solution.
* Documentation detailing setup, dependencies, usage instructions, troubleshooting, and storage management.
* A responsive and intuitive web-based control interface.

Please implement this solution following best practices in software development, ensuring readability, maintainability, and scalability.
